I started cold emailing people during my freshman year of college. I've cold emailed my way into an internship interview at Dropbox, multiple research fellowships, an internship offer from a FinTech startup, mentorship, and more.

More recently, I started e-mailing unicorn startup founders for advice. Surprisingly, some of them actually respond. 

In this article, I'll share some tactics on how I do it.

TL;DR: subject line matters most, keep everything concise, build rapport, personalize, and follow up.

# Why people don't cold email

I've recently started to realize how beautiful e-mail is. With email, you can reach very successful people easily and for free. 

E-mail is a truly open communication network. Unlike phone numbers, an e-mail is very easy to guess because it's explicitly linked to someone's identity. Unlike social networks, you don't need them to accept your request to e-mail them. 

People really underestimate the power of the cold e-mail. I think there are a few reasons:
1. They don't want to seem annoying.
2. They don't want to get rejected.
3. It's extremely boring, menial, and grindy.

I can empathize because we all have egos and nobody wants to feel annoying or get rejected. 

Some people are annoyed by cold e-mails, but that's not necessarily your problem. If you do it correctly for the right people, then it doesn't matter if a few people are bothered by it.

You are also almost definitely not going to get 100% reply rate. You just have to accept it. That's also okay, because it's a numbers game and people are busy. 

I think there's a common tendency to believe that successful founders might be too busy for us. However, unlike celebrities, I think they're a lot more willing to help because people aren't constantly trying to get their attention or exploit them, and because they've been there themselves. I've never tried reaching out to a celebrity cold so I can't say for sure how responsive they'd be though.

It is definitely a grind sometimes, but it's well worth it. I cold e-mailed dozens of recruiters my sophomore year to get an internship. Most didn't respond or even read it, but Dropbox and Bolt sent me a coding challenge; the Dropbox one even led to an interview. In that case, getting "rejected" didn't matter.
